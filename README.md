# Interactive Portfolio

Hello! My name is Jack Anstey and this is my interactive portfolio. This is a one stop shop to see what relevant skills I have as a computer scientist along with my prior projects and experience.

If you're curious what I'm using to power this website, read on! If not, you can see how this repository looks live [here](https://jackanstey.com).

## Hosting & Pipeline

Both the domain and the server that this repo is stored on is managed through AWS. I also setup a pipeline such that when this GitHub repo is updated, so is the S3 bucket on AWS.

## Sources

To make this website possible, I used Font Awesome for their sick icons used throughout the website along with Bootstrap to make creating my SCSS just a little bit less painful.

## Thanks

Thank you very much taking a look! I hope you enjoy viewing my work and what I have to offer.
